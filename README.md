Mini Full Stack Project
This project is your first foray into full stack development! We want you to create a CRUD application that stores some user-generated data in a database and is also able to retrieve and manipulate that data properly.

This application should have a React front end, Express server and PostgreSQL database.

You will be in groups of 2, and our intention is that you will be “pairing” throughout the whole project. Please do your best to put into practice everything you know about quality pair programming. The pairing element of this project is aimed at helping you not only in your career as a developer, but also to pass your pair programming assessment for your Z-Prefix!

You can choose whatever app you want, but keep in mind you have less than 2 full days to do this. Pick something simple, like a grocery list or to do list! Building a VERY simple full stack app is BETTER than finishing half of a more complicated project. Remember: iterative design is your BEST FRIEND!

You will not need to present these, but instructors will collect and evaluate your code after you submit your repositories on Thursday before retro. They will also periodically hop into your breakout room to see how things are going. Please reach out for support if you have issues you are unable to solve on your own!
